# Generative Adversarial Networks

Here I have implemented simple version of GAN using TensorFlow framework. The testing has been done on  MNIST dataset.

*The structure of this network looks like the picture below.*

## Dataset

The dataset used in this mini-project is MNIST hand written digits dataset. You can import it into your project by using TensorFlow built-in functions.

## Dependencies

> *  [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org) 1.10.4
> *  [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) 1.5.1
> *  [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) 1.2.0


## Python version

The Python version that I have used in this notebook is 3.5. But 3.6 is supported as well.


## Code

Whole code for this project can be found inside **GAN.ipynb**.

## Run

To run this project you will need some software, like Anaconda, which provides support for running .ipynb files (Jupyter Notebook).

After making sure you have that, you can run from a terminal or cmd next lines:


`ipython notebook GAN.ipynb`

or

`jupyter notebook GAN.ipynb`
